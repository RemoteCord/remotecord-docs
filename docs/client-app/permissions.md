# User Permissons

The RemoteCord Client app allows you to set different permissions to each user that you friend.

To visualize this, we can imagine 2 users: _User1_ & _User2_. With user permissions, _User1_ can have full access while _User2_ can only view tasks.

:::warning Warning
By default, all users you friend have **full access permissions**. Make sure to set proper permissions for untrusted users before allowing them to access your machine.
