# Installation

Installation of RemoteCord can be done in less than 5 minutes.

## Client App

:::info Info
Windows may prompt you with a _SmartScreen_ warning before running the installer. This is because our app is not currently signed by Microsoft.
:::

Firstly, you need to install the client app on the device you wish to remote access. You can do so with the following steps:

1. Go to https://remotecord.app/get-started and download the Windows app.
2. In the installer, click _Next_ and _Install_.
3. Once in the app, use a Google account to log-in & activate your account.

## RemoteCord Bot

You don't need to install the bot itself, but you will need to take a few steps before being able to properly use it.

1. Join our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1043524973517615164&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapii.remotecord.app%2Fapi%2Fcontrollers%2Fget-email&scope=email)
   - You should be prompted with a permissions screen from Discord. Click _Authorise_ at the bottom right.
2. Once you've joined, locate the _RemoteCord_ bot at the top of the members list & open a DM with it.
3. Once in DMs with the bot, run `/activate` to ensure your account's activated in our Database.
