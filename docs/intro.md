## Why RemoteCord?

We believe we live in an age where it's no longer required to expose your home network to the internet. And while there are alternatives or ways to make it protocols like RDP secure, it's often not practical unless you absolutely have to or are in a business environment.

RemoteCord aims to directly eliminate this issue. We made installation and configuration plain easy to make sure _anybody_ can reliably access their devices from anywhere.
